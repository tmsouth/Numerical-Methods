# Numerical Methods Files

Just some files made during the 2017 MATH2102 course: Numercial Methods.

Files create a gif of a complex fractal based on what attractors the points go to. 

There is still an issue with the colouring changing that I haven't fixed yet.

May include other NM files from the course once the coursework changes so you lil cheaty kids can't get off that easy.
